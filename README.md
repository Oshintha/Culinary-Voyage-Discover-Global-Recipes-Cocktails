# Culinary-Voyage-Discover-Global-Recipes-Cocktails
Develop a single-page application that allows users to explore a diverse range of
recipes and cocktails from around the world. This project focuses on the core React
concepts: state management with useState, side effects with useEffect, and
reusability with custom hooks. The aim is to interact with TheMealDB and
TheCocktailDB APIs for fetching data.
